# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am Prashant Goswami, currently pursuing Master’s in Information Systems from University of Maryland, College Park. I’m a passionate data engineer with a strong background in cloud technologies like Microsoft Azure and data tools such as SQL, Python, and Spark. I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects that improved operational efficiency by streamlining ETL processes and optimizing distributed systems. One of my strengths is the ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical teams, ensuring smooth collaboration across functions. I love working in fast-paced environments and thrive on learning new technologies, always staying on top of industry trends. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new places while biking, hitting the trails, and unwinding with a good movie or series. I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion for learning to a team that values collaboration and innovation.
